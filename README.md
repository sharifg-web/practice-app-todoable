# To-doable App

This coding exercise was meant to test what I've learned from the React module of the Udemy course "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu. It has a straightforward functionality - add and delete to-do items. It stores the new input value in an array after passing it back to the App and then mapped on display or filtered on deletion.

## What was learned from this coding exercise:
* State Hook
* Mapping data to components using the map() and filter() methods
* Spread Operator
* Component Tree
* Event Handling
