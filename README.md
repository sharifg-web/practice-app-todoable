# To-doable App

A coding exercise meant to test what I've learned from the React module of the Udemy course "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu. It has a straightforward functionality - add and delete to-do items. It stores the new input value in an array after passing it back to the App and maps them on display or filters on deletion.

## What was learned from this coding exercise:
* State Hook
* Mapping data to components using the map() and filter() methods
* Spread Operator
* Component Tree
* Event Handling
